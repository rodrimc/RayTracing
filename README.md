RayTracing
-----------------

This is a Ray Tracing implementation in C++.

This code implements rays' intersection with spheres and plane.
There is also reflection.

It was implemented and tested on ubuntu 14.04, compiled using
g++ 4.8.2 and depends on SDL2 to render the scene. There is
a minimalist makefile.

Compiling
-----------------
To compile just clone the repository and type: make. You
need the SDL2 to compile it without problems.

Dependencies
-----------------
* [SDL2] (http://www.libsdl.org/)

Run
-----------------
The executable will be created in the folder "build". To run
the program, just type ./RayTracingT3, passing as argument the
width, height and the fov (field of view) desired -- this last
argumnet is optional (default value is 60ยบ).

Example
-----------------
The following image was generated typing the
following command after build the source:

./RayTracingT3 800 600 60
